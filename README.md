# The Sherlock Layout

This project was born from the realisation that I will probably spend the majority of my working life using a keyboard. Having a keyboard layout specifically suited to me and my writing needs could potentially have an enormous positive effect on my daily life due to the sheer number of hours I spend with the keyboard in my hands. While the upfront cost of learning a new layout will be bordering on enomous themselves, it is a one-time cost that is easily justified by the effort saved in the long run.

I decided to create a custom keyboard layout, different from the QWERTY we all know. My approach is very derivative of [Mr. White's eponymous result](https://github.com/mw8/white_keyboard_layout), who inspired me to take this project to the next level, by showing that it was possible in the first place. 

I named the layout Sherlock because the entire Sherlock Holmes collection is used for input -- but very much also because this whole project is equal parts pretentious and smart.
